# ðŸ“‹ MLOps Zoomcamp: Week 1 Notes

When you are designing a machine learning system, your job doesn't end with building the modelâ€”and achieving a high accuracy score and a low validation error! For the model to be actually helpfulâ€”you will have to consider deploying it, and also ensure that the model's performance does not degrade over time. And MLOps is a set of *best practices* for putting machine learning models into production.

## ðŸŽ¯ Steps in a Machine Learning Project
The various stages in a machine learning project can be broadly captured in the following three steps:
1. **Design**: In the `design` step, you are considering the problem at handâ€”to decide whether or not you'll need a machine learning algorithm to achieve objective 
2. **Train**: Once you decide on using a machine learning algorithm, you `train` the model and optimize its performance on the validation dataset.
3. **Operate**: The `operate` state captures the performance of the model after it's deployed. Some of the questions that you'll answer throughout the course, include:
  - If the performance of the model degrades, can you retrain the model in a cost-effective manner?
  - How do you ensure that the deployed model performs as expectedâ€”that is, how do you monitor the model's performance in production?
  - What are the challenges associated with monitoring ML models?

## âš™ Environment Setup

Recommended development environment: Linux

### 1. Download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python
```sh
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh

```

### 2. Update existing packages
```sh
$ sudo apt update
```
### 3. Install Docker
```sh
$ sudo apt install docker.io
```

### 4. Install Docker Compose

4.1 Install docker-compose in a separate directory
```sh
$ mkdir soft
$ cd soft
```

4.2 Get the latest release of Docker Compose, go to https://github.com/docker/compose and download the release for your OS.

```sh
$ wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.5.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -O docker-compose
```
4.3 Make it executable
```sh
$ chmod +x docker-compose
```
4.4 Add to path
```sh
$ nano .bashrc
# In .bashrc, add:
export PATH="${HOME}/soft:${PATH}"
# Run
$ source .bashrc
```

### [Optional] Run Docker without `sudo`
```sh
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
### 5. Run Docker
```sh
$ docker run hello-world
``
