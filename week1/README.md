# ðŸ“‹ MLOps Zoomcamp: Week 1 Notes

When you are designing a machine learning system, your job doesn't end with building the modelâ€”and achieving a high accuracy score and a low validation error! For the model to be actually helpfulâ€”you will have to consider deploying it, and also ensure that the model's performance does not degrade over time. And MLOps is a set of *best practices* for putting machine learning models into production.

## ðŸŽ¯ Steps in a Machine Learning Project
The various stages in a machine learning project can be broadly captured in the following three steps:
1. **Design**: In the `design` step, you are considering the problem at handâ€”to decide whether or not you'll need a machine learning algorithm to achieve objective 
2. **Train**: Once you decide on using a machine learning algorithm, you `train` the model and optimize its performance on the validation dataset.
3. **Operate**: The `operate` state captures the performance of the model after it's deployed. Some of the questions that you'll answer throughout the course, include:
  - If the performance of the model degrades, can you retrain the model in a cost-effective manner?
  - How do you ensure that the deployed model performs as expectedâ€”that is, how do you monitor the model's performance in production?
  - What are the challenges associated with monitoring ML models?
